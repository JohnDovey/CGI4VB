# CGI4VB
CGI Web Module for VB 6 used to create CGI applications in VB 6

This library is now available from several differnt places on the internet, but as far as can be determined, the original location is here:

It is an excellent and fun way to write compiled CGI apps while learning the basic (no pun intended) ins and outs of CGI programming.

# New port

I had a lot of fun with this piece of code back a few years, and ended up using it extensively to impliment some pretty serious websites. It was the safest and simplest way, at the time, to secure the source of the website and access some strange databases to get all sorts of things on the net that were impossible to accomplish without hundreds of lines of c code. 

As a hobby/project, I'd like to port this to VB.Net, and specifically to be able to compile under mono. Anyone else is more than welcome to jump in and contribute.
